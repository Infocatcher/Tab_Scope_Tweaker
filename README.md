This restartless extension for Firefox provides some tweaks for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/tab-scope/">Tab Scope</a>:
* Display tab URL in preview popup
* Crop title at center (“Loo…oong” instead of “Loooooo…”)
* Move title label to top of popup

I used my own modification of Tab Scope in some years (oh!) and finally decide to create a better “patch”.
<br>So this extension just does what I want.
